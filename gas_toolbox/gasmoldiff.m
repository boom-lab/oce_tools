% DESCRIPTION:
%    Diffusion coefficients of various gases in fresh/sea water
%
% INPUT:  (if S and T are not singular they must have same dimensions)
%   S = salinity    [PSS-78]
%   T = temperature [degree C]
%   gas = 'He','Ne','Ar','Kr','Xe','N2','O2' or 'CO2'
% 
% OUTPUT:
%   D = diffusion coefficient   [m^2/s] 
%   Sc = Schmidt number

%    Ar freshwaters values are extrapolated from Jahne et al. 1987
%       He, Ne, Kr, Xe values at each temperature were fitted to D vs. mass^-0.5 
%       relationship to predict Ar at those temperatures, then Ar was fit to a 
%       ln(D_Ar) vs. 1/T(K) relationship to obtain Eyring equation coefficients
%    O2 and N2 freshwater values from  Ferrell and Himmelblau, 1967.

%    Correction for salinity is based on Jahne's observed average 4.9% decrease in 
%       diffusivity for H2 and He in 35.5 ppt NaCl solution
%
%    for Ne, the Jahne values compare well with and fall between those of
%       Wise and Houghton 1968 and Holz et al. 1994
%    for Ar, the extrapolated Jahne values compare well with Wise and Houghton 1968,
%       O'Brien and Hyslop 1977, and a numerical simulation by Bourg et al. 2008
%       but are higher than other reported values
%    for Kr, the Jahne values compare well with Wise and Houghton 1968,
%       and a numerical simulation by Bourg et al. 2008
%    for Xe, the Jahne values compare well with Pollack 1981, and a numerical 
%       simulation by Bourg et al. 2008, but fall significantly above Wise and Houghton 1968
%       and below Weingartner et al. 1992
%    for O2, there is general agreement among measurements. The Ferrel and Himmelblau values 
%       agree reasonably well with Baird and Davidson 1962, Wise and Houghton 1966,
%       Duda and Vrentas 1968, O'Brien and Hyslop 1977, and the Wilke and Change (1955) theory 
%       as tabulated by Wanninkhof 1992, but lie below Krieger et al 1967
%    for N2, there is less agreement. The Ferrel and Himmelblau values 
%       agree reasonably well with Baird and Davidson 1962, O'Brien and Hyslop 1977, 
%       and the Wilke and Change (1955) theory as tabulated by Wanninkhof 1992, 
%       but lie significantly below the values of Wise and Houghton 1966 and Krieger et al 1967
%    for He, I did not investigate comparisons of data, but chose Jahne 
%       since their work for other gases appears to be the best
